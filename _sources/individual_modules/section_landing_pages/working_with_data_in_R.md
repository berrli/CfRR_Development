# Working With Data in R

## Overview 

Over two sessions, learn how to use the Tidyverse to work with data in R. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed to help you manipulate, clean and analyse data. This course will introduce you to the functionality of several key packages, while also discussing some of the conventions the Tidyverse uses when working with data. By the end of the course, participants should feel confident to continue using the Tidyverse to work with datasets in R.

## Course Objectives 
On completion of this series of workshops, participants will:
- Be able to explain what is meant by the ‘tidy’ format (a widely recognised convention for structuring data).
- Know how to read tabular data from a file to a dataframe.
- Be able to manipulate datasets, including creating new variables, filtering data, summarising and sorting data.
- Know how to join multiple datasets together and reshape data.
- Learn how to work with strings and dates (as time permits).
- Gain hands on experience working with R notebooks for analysis.

## Pre-requisite Knowledge 
This course is for participants who already have some programming experience with R. It assumes familiarity with things like: creating and setting variables, the basic data structures (dataframes, vectors, lists), using functions, running R code and viewing console output, installing R packages and using R packages in your own code. Experience with R notebooks is not required.
