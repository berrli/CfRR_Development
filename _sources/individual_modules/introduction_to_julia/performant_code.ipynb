    "### Type Stability\n",
    "**Definition**: Type stability means that the type of a variable's value is predictable and consistent within a function. Julia's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler can optimize type stable code more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, type stability is achieved through the use of the type hinting done with the use of `::Vector{Int}` in the function arguement declaration. The `::Vector{Int}` in Julia specifies that the variable should be a vector (array) of integers, ensuring type stability and enabling the compiler to optimize the code more effectively. Type hinting is achieved with the use of the `::`."
